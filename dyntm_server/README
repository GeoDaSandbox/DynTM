             This script should not be run directly on your servers,
             just use it a guide.  The script was developed on a Blank EC2 with
             the latest Ubuntu image, the script will complete the install process
             in that specific environment.
             This scripts downloads packages from S3, but these are the same packages
             that are located in the dist folder.

           the DataStore model on Google AppEngine to Amazon's SimpleDB.
           Also supports "standalone" for development purposes.
           -- in practice "standalone" is adequate for many use cases.
dynTileMapper -- The original DynTM code.
                 This code includes all of the low level rending code,
                 tile generation, etc.  It also includes the original backage

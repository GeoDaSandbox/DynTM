geodaWebServices.lib was copied directly from dynTileMapper.dtm_wsgi.lib in order to support DynTM as a django application with minimal changes.

lib contains an alternative database model to Django or Google AppEngine.  The database model support flexible backends, currently supported are FileSystem and Amazon's S3.

This should be considered an Alpha project.
